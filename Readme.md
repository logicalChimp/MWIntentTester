The MWIntentTester is intended to simplify the development of applications that use the external Intents-based API published by the Metawatch Manager Community Edition.

It includes a simple HTML-based document giving an overview of the supported intents and their expected/available parameters, and a small program to enable manual generation of intents that would normally be generated by the watch.  This simplifies testing of the external app, and allows debugging in the Android emulator.

Current limitations:
*) there is no support for the Button intents - yet
*) the app does not listen for / display MetaWatch intents generated by the external app - yet

Note that apps written for the MetaWatch Manager Community Edition should also be compatible with the MWM Noah Edition.  They may also compatible with the 'official' MetaWatch Manager, but that is not confirmed.
